1
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,322
<i>First thing you'll learn</i>
<i>is that nothing is what it seems.</i>

2
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,415
<i>Ignore your assumptions.</i>

3
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,792
<i>Don't trust anything. </i>

4
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,423
<i>What you see, what you hear,</i>

5
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,511
<i>what people tell you, </i>
<i>what you think you remember...</i>

6
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,874
<i>We are Envoys,</i>
<i>and we take what is offered.</i>

7
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,597
<i>Let experience wash over you.</i>

8
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,684
<i>Absorb it like a sponge.</i>

9
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,437
<i>Expect nothing.</i>

10
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,816
<i>Only then can you be prepared </i>
<i>for anything.</i>

11
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,002
Fuck.

12
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,674
Fucking bone fragments.
Always get goddamn splinters.

13
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,343
Who do you think they are?

14
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,928
Who cares? We're getting paid.

15
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,014
Have you always been such an asshole?

16
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,017
Every sleeve, every time.

17
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,005
What?

18
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,383
CTAC praetorians, 12. Lethal loads.

19
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,760
You see through the walls now?

20
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,889
Three seconds or less. Move!

21
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,501
<i>Your body is not who you are.</i>

22
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,675
<i>You shed it like a snake sheds its skin.</i>

23
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,679
<i>Leave it, forgotten, behind you.</i>

24
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,809
The only way you'll learn
is by watching, so watch.

25
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,519
Didn't cover this in the basic briefing.  You'll be fine.

26
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,356
They can barely walk at first.
Have to pull him out.

27
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,983
I'm gonna get this shit all over me.

28
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,860
You'll get used to it.
Just decant him.

29
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,695
We've got four more to do
in the next hour.

30
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,742
I think I'm gonna be sick.

31
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,245
Not until you learn how to take out
the umbilicus, you aren't.

32
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,373
Like this. Just give it a good hard jerk.

33
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,045
What the fuck

34
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,632
Sometimes they flop around. Usually
means their last sleeve died violently.

35
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,768
<i>Make it personal.</i>

36
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,645
<i>It is you. You are the weapon.</i>

37
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,190
<i>You are the killer and the destroyer.</i> <i>It is you. You are the weapon.</i>

38
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,279
<i>You are the killer and destroyer.</i>

39
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,287
Get down!

40
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,550
This can't be normal.
-He'll be fine. Just get him in the chair.

41
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,095
You get him in the chair.
 All right, buddy, enough of that.

42
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,891
Shit!

43
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,269
We need help. Help! Help!

44
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,021
-You broke my goddamn nose.
 Help! We need help.

45
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,235
Fucking rerun went mental on me.

46
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,320
Have to sedate you
if you don't settle down.

47
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,364
-I am fucking bleeding here!
-Shut up!

48
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,158
Listen, asshole. You better calm down.

49
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,584
How long

50
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,553
Two hundred and fifty years.

51
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,640
Get me a mirror.

52
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,143
No mirrors here. You need time
to adjust to your new sleeve.

53
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,020
You risk schism or a psychotic break.

54
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,896
He's already fucking psychotic!

55
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,565
Get me a fucking mirror!

56
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,545
You almost fucking killed me, man.

57
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,881
I hate getting shot.

58
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,342
Where am I?

59
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,011
Alcatraz Prison. Bay City.

60
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,554
What planet, genius?

61
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,513
Earth.

62
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,482
Which way's the shower?

63
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,168
<i>One thing I can promise you:</i>

64
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,047
<i>coming back from the dead is a bitch.</i>

65
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,802
<i>Every single time.</i>

66
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,804
<i>Welcome to Alcatraz. </i>

67
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,223
<i>You've successfully completed </i>
<i>your prison sentence. </i>

68
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,268
<i>You may notice you are no longer </i>
<i>in the body you arrived in. </i>

69
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,688
Now that you have paid your debt
to society,

70
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,025
you have been resleeved
from our available inventory of prisoners.

71
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,694
You may feel confused or strange.

72
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,406
<i>After all,</i>
<i>you're not supposed to be here.</i>

73
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,868
Disorientation,
visual and auditory hallucinations,

74
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,080
and even low-grade amnesia are normal.

75
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:50,042
But don't worry. This orientation
will answer all of your questions.

76
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,920
This is a cortical stack.

77
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,797
As Protectorate citizens,

78
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,426
we each have one implanted
when we are one year old.

79
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,723
Inside is pure human mind,
coded and stored as DHF:

80
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,392
Digital Human Freight.

81
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,230
Your consciousness can be downloaded
into any stack, in any sleeve.

82
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:17,069
You can even needlecast in minutes to
a sleeve anywhere in the Settled Worlds.

83
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,113
A sleeve is replaceable.

84
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,324
But if your stack is destroyed, you die.

85
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,910
There's no coming back from real death.

86
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,287
Warden wants to see you.

87
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,373
So, avoid blunt force trauma
to the base of the brain

88
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,792
and energy weapons fired at the head.

89
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,928
<i>When you wake up, </i>
<i>the world will not be what it was.</i>

90
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,764
<i>And neither will you.</i>

91
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,976
<i>They have forgotten who and what we are.</i>

92
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,522
<i>Make them remember.</i>

93
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,190
Put that out.

94
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,781
You...

95
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,409
File's incomplete, parts of it sealed.

96
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
What is here?

97
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,290
Espionage, terrorism,
crimes against the state,

98
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,459
and more murders than I can count.

99
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,627
<i>Takeshi Kovacs.</i>

100
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,797
You're under arrest for treason
against the Protectorate.

101
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,970
Working for the terrorist leader
Quellcrist Falconer.

102
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,184
I didn't work for her.
It was more like an autonomous collective.

103
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,562
Close your goddamn mouth, you traitor,

104
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,605
or I'll put a hole
right through your head.

105
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,898
You moron.

106
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,235
Good to see you too, Jaeger.
Been a while.

107
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,570
Chase is over.

108
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,448
Just give me an excuse.

109
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,160
I know you got orders
not to make me into a martyr, so...

110
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,205
be a good little grunt and take me in.

111
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,082
<i>Sleeve's fragged</i>
<i>but the stack's okay, sir.</i>

112
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212
Who's the bitch?

113
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,132
Nobody. Just a local merc.

114
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,426
She doesn't even know who I am.

115
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,391
You should've been respectful to me.
She would've lived.

116
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,477
And when they
finally arrested you,

117
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,771
you gunned down your own partner
in the stack.

118
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,733
Report says she was shot
from behind, so...

119
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,194
along with everything else,
you're a coward.

120
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,908
Don't you have anything to say?

121
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,413
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry,
I was waiting for a question.

122
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,834
It was all monologue there for a while,
so I kind of tuned out.

123
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,006
This is your parole document,

124
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,677
certifying that your DHF was shipped
from Millsport Maximum Security Prison,

125
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,681
received here intact,
and sleeved in this body,

126
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,102
which came equipped with military-grade
neurachem and combat muscle memory.

127
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,314
You've been provided with
clothing and incidentals

128
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,108
as per the specifications
of Bancroft Industries,

129
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,153
which has leased you.

130
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,406
As such, you are the property
of Laurens Bancroft

131
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,783
for the duration of that lease.

132
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,993
Property

133
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,328
You don't have any.

134
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,122
Failure to comply
with the terms of this parole

135
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,999
will result in your immediate desleeving

136
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,168
<i>and return here,</i>

137
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:07,925
<i>to serve out the rest of your term,</i>
<i>which does not appear to have an end date.</i>

138
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,259
You're going to screw up.

139
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,471
Do something violent,
hurt someone, kill someone.

140
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,723
I know people like you.

141
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,892
There aren't any people like me.

142
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,812
<i>Not anymore.</i>

143
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,360
<i>There will be places where </i>
<i>they'll wait. The people left behind.</i>

144
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,913
<i>Wait to see their friends, lovers,</i>

145
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,332
<i>parents, children come back to them,</i>

146
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,044
<i>riding unfamiliar bodies </i>
<i>out from digitized exile. </i>

147
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,964
<i>They'll look into the eyes of strangers,</i>

148
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,216
<i>searching for a glimpse of the person </i>
<i>they've lost.</i>

149
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,387
Cindy?

150
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,596
Kristin Ortega.

151
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,765
I'll be driving you
to the Bancroft residence.

152
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,103
-Welcome to Bay City.
 Hey, hey, hey!

153
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,939
What have you done to our daughter?
Cindy's seven years old!

154
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,649
You get whatever's in inventory.

155
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,445
She was murdered in a hit-and-run.
The law says she gets a free sleeve.

156
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,696
That one's free.

157
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,324
If you don't like it, pay for an upgrade
or put her back in storage.

158
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,661
Daddy, please don't put me
back in the dark.

159
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,873
They put a kid in that old lady?

160
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,750
Victim restitution.

161
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,918
The state just gives you
what they have on hand.

162
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,462
Broken down crap like that.

163
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,506
Prisons lease out the good sleeves
for profit.

164
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,341
It's very humane.

165
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,801
You don't approve?

166
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,263
-They don't have that where I come from.
 And where would that be?

167
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,557
Yeah!
 What's going on here?

168
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,975
You are all going to burn!

169
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:40,934
Yeah!

170
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,853
Let the dead speak!

171
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,440
Justice! Let the dead speak!
Justice! Let the dead speak!

172
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,234
-Justice! Let the dead speak!
 No resleeving!

173
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,362
Shouldn't have come back!
Shouldn't have come back!

174
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,367
Justice! Let the dead speak!
Justice! Let the dead speak!

175
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,662
No resleeving! No resleeving!
No resleeving!

176
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,039
You will not be forgiven.

177
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,248
Come on. Let's go.

178
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,669
God is watching.
He will judge you for your sins!

179
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,505
Gonna keep him busy a while.

180
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,559
Spirit Savers and Afterlifers.

181
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,687
653 failed,
and still they can't stop yelling.

182
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,231
What is 653?

183
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:31,360
Something about spinning up murder victims
to testify who killed them.

184
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,446
Why wouldn't you spin them up
if they're witnesses to their own murder?

185
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,116
Archdiocese says
you only get the sleeve you're born with.

186
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,576
Once it dies,
they spin you back up for anything,

187
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,330
even to identify your killer,
your soul goes to hell.

188
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,998
What do you think, huh?

189
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,876
I think no one in the archdiocese
has ever been murdered.

190
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,844
You had to go be a dick.

191
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,014
-Stay down, Kovacs.

192
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,599
Fuck you!

193
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,119
I said stay the fuck down.

194
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,486
What were you in for?

195
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,572
You know,
little bit of this, little bit of that.

196
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,449
Blew some shit up and killed some people.

197
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,911
Some people just need killing.

198
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,996
And how do you decide who deserves to die?

199
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,167
Depends on the day.
I mean, anything can set me off.

200
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,046
Interstellar dictatorship, genocide,
people who talk too much.

201
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,968
Right now, I'm feeling pretty hostile
towards Laurens Bancroft,

202
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,346
-whoever the fuck he is.
 Oh, come on.

203
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,847
Everyone knows Bancroft.

204
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,600
-He's one of the first founding Meths.

205
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,393
You don't know what's a Meth?

206
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,356
How can you not know?
You're dressed like one.

207
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,983
Like I said,
I'm not from around here.

208
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,905
"And the days of Methuselah
were 969 years."

209
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,662
It's Laurens Bancroft.
He's over 360 years old.

210
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,129
They call it the Aerium.

211
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,351
Guess they don't have this
where you come from either, huh?

212
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:22,239
So, where were you born?
Like, home planet, that kind of thing?

213
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,615
Not here.

214
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,451
-You ask a lot of questions.

215
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,829
That's my <i>abuela.</i> She always said,

216
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,164
"Kristin, you can find a way
to talk to anybody."

217
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,834
Especially when they're trapped in a car
with you.

218
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,339
Our quick and messy little lives
are so small to them.

219
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,341
They build their homes up here

220
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,303
so the clutter of our existence
is out of their sight.

221
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,312
-Right there.

222
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,688
You see the ground?

223
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,481
It's right there.

224
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,698
Wow. Really stuck that landing.
You're not a driver, are you?

225
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,992
I said I worked security.
I didn't say for who.

226
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,661
So this hasn't been a conversation,
it's been an interrogation.

227
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,663
Last chance. Just give me a name.

228
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,459
Takeshi Kovacs. Look me up.

229
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,390
You can't be who you say you are.
All the Envoys died.

230
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,641
All except one.

231
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,770
-Not another step, Ortega.
-Oh, come on.

232
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,480
I'm Bay City PD and you know it, Curtis.

233
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,356
Lower your weapons
and tell me where your boss is,

234
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,484
because I really would like
a fucking word.

235
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,279
Lieutenant Ortega.
You're trespassing on private property.

236
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,366
Apparently, you've stolen
one of our limos as well.

237
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,409
I could have you shot.

238
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,953
Yeah, go ahead. Try.

239
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,425
Why did you drive the Envoy?
Isaac was supposed to do that.

240
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:10,055
Look, I'm not drunk, okay?
I was just loosening up a little.

241
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,556
Let go of me!

242
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,600
We picked him up on a DUI.

243
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,852
Which is how we came
into possession of your vehicle.

244
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,896
You all right? This is unacceptable.

245
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,564
Just stop it, all right, Mom?

246
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,900
It's your fault for sending me.
I'm not a chauffeur.

247
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,153
Go inside. This is police harassment.

248
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:30,075
Yeah, there's your kid, there's your car,
and there's your... new pet terrorist.

249
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,034
You're welcome.

250
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,370
The terrorist can hear you.
I'm standing right here.

251
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,289
Yeah, good, 'cause we're not done,
you and me.

252
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,800
Forgive me. I'm Miriam Bancroft.
We've not been properly introduced.

253
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,553
Welcome to Suntouch House.

254
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,361
Shouldn't that be in a museum?

255
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,574
I have a weakness
for Elder civilization artifacts.

256
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,870
I collect them, among other things.

257
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,331
This must have cost a fortune
to ship here.

258
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,624
Hmm.

259
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,960
Several fortunes, actually.

260
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,879
And a few lifetimes.

261
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,673
But cost was no object.

262
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,260
This is the only Songspire tree on Earth.

263
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,388
No one really knows what they are.

264
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,601
They could have functioned as part
of Elder civilization architecture.

265
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,147
The largest ones ever recorded
are thousands of meters high.

266
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,236
I know. I've seen them.

267
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,705
Stronghold, of course.

268
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,459
Laurens is in his study.

269
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,669
I'll show you up.

270
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,558
Is it true you can look into
a person's eyes

271
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,685
and know exactly what they're thinking?

272
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,314
Hmm, Envoys don't read minds.

273
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,691
What a pity.

274
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,446
Good luck, Mr. Kovacs.

275
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,461
Mr. Kovacs.

276
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,799
My apologies my son failed
to drive you here.

277
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:56,179
You have to forgive
my endlessly misplaced optimism.

278
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,309
That's all right.
The ride was very instructive.

279
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,521
Hmm. Yes, I'm sure it was.

280
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:09,651
Details are, after all,
an Envoy's stock-in-trade.

281
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,861
Or were, I should say.

282
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,533
"Immersion and total absorb."
Wasn't that the term, hmm?

283
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,536
"Whatever answer you may seek,

284
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,039
it is precisely
where you are not looking."

285
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,917
-Hmm, you've read Falconer.
-Ah.

286
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,461
I was alive during the Uprising, yeah.

287
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,256
Yeah? So was I.

288
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,926
Oh.  Yes, my apologies. Uh...

289
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,387
It's all in the distant past for me,

290
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,890
but for you, of course,
it's all rather different.

291
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,394
There are very few of us now...

292
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:50,567
who saw firsthand
what the Envoys could do. Ah-ha. Yes.

293
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,280
And I have to admit that
I had a grudging admiration for you.

294
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,781
Trained by Quell herself

295
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,618
to be the most formidable fighting force
that the galaxy had ever seen.

296
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,496
Well, that would sound better
if we hadn't lost.

297
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,500
This might... might interest you.

298
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,464
Oh, it's all corneal streaming now.

299
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:16,968
There's something about the simplicity
of holding the written word in your hand.

300
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,846
-The very heft of it.

301
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,059
As men have done
for countless of centuries before us.

302
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,312
It is a tie to our shared past.

303
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,482
-I bought it at auction.

304
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,359
Eh, supposedly it...

305
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,152
<i>Envoys take what is offered.</i>

306
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,322
...is written by Falconer in her own hand.

307
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,870
Judging by your reaction, it appears
I might have got what I paid for.

308
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,455
Listen to me.

309
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,584
I spent this entire morning
being well and truly fucked around with,

310
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,171
so, uh, let me be painfully clear.

311
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,843
Some things can't be bought.

312
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,638
Like me.

313
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,642
Now, I didn't ask you
to bring me back into this world.

314
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,645
In fact, I fought a war
to stop people like you from happening.

315
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:13,441
So, if someone doesn't tell me right now
what the fuck this is all about...

316
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,861
I might very well lose my temper.

317
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,452
Hmm.

318
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,206
Understood.

319
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,624
Now...

320
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,293
this is a full pardon, signed by the president
of the Protectorate.

321
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,758
No one has that kind of power.

322
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,596
Power is a matter of influence,
Mr. Kovacs.

323
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,726
And I have had a great deal of influence
at the UN.

324
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,645
If you agree to my terms,

325
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:55,316
your sentence will be reduced
to time served.

326
00:28:55,775 --> 00:29:00,071
And then I will open up a very generous
line of credit in your name.

327
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,532
DNA trace accessible.

328
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,117
When the investigation is over,

329
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,830
you may keep this sleeve
or choose another.

330
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,583
To your own specifications.

331
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:15,170
Finally, I will pay you a salary

332
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,339
of 50 million UN credits.

333
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,468
That's a fortune.

334
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,095
Have any future you want.

335
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:25,847
Now...

336
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,351
all I ask of you...

337
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,480
is that you solve a murder.

338
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:34,981
Whose?

339
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,404
Mine.

340
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,827
Stop obsessing.

341
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,498
So he was a soldier.
So he's still just another rerun.

342
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,042
No, an Envoy wasn't just a soldier.

343
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:58,171
Drop into any sleeve on any planet
and be combat-ready in minutes.

344
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,548
Just read it. Read it.

345
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,845
"Absorb local language,
culture and customs,

346
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,931
and pass in almost any environment."

347
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:12,268
"Infiltrate and manipulate computers,
systems, other people."

348
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,603
Kovacs is a ticking bomb!

349
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,981
Ortega, calm down.
 I'm fucking calm.

350
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:26,115
Okay. Bancroft resleeved
a terrorist into our city. Why?

351
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,408
Um...

352
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,037
Hired muscle?
Uh, expensive toy? I don't know.

353
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,082
Maybe he's planning to invade
another star system over the weekend

354
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,708
like a Meth version of laser ball.

355
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,293
Who the fuck knows?

356
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:41,297
You made me swear.
Listen. You need to take up meditation.

357
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,383
This is a good time to meditate?

358
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,468
Look, Kristin.

359
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,639
-Okay.
-No. Listen to me. It's wrong!

360
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,140
I know.

361
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,145
Whoever he is,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

362
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,856
-No.

363
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,983
Who's afraid? I'm not.
What are you talking about?

364
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,861
Okay, look, what I meant is...

365
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,071
Kovacs is gonna go back on ice.

366
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,908
Where he belongs. End of story.

367
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,378
This is where I died.

368
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,298
When Miriam found me, my head...

369
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,842
...had been vaporized.

370
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,386
It's an energy weapon?

371
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,347
Yes. A particle blaster.

372
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,895
I keep one for personal protection
in a biometric safe

373
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,939
that only Miriam and I can open.

374
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,150
Go ahead, say it.

375
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,235
Everyone else has.

376
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,908
Either I committed suicide,
or my wife murdered me.

377
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,953
But you're still here,
meaning your stack is intact, so...

378
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,497
you must remember what happened.

379
00:31:56,581 --> 00:32:00,251
I'm afraid it's completely destroyed.
"RD'ed," as they say.

380
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,377
Then how--

381
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:06,591
Have you ever heard of full-spectrum DHF
remote storage backup?

382
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,634
Yeah.

383
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,179
Just never met anyone filthy rich enough
to afford it.

384
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,264
Well...

385
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,059
I need to show you something.

386
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,064
Sometimes I come up here

387
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:25,568
when I have decisions to make
or difficulties to face.

388
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,862
Think about the ancient explorers,

389
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,531
back when one could spend a lifetime

390
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,452
pursuing the possibilities of the Earth,
the oceans, the stars.

391
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,705
I was born in London.

392
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,502
When I first moved to what was then,
of course, called the United States,

393
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:48,383
it still had the faintest echoes
of the new and brash culture

394
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,093
that it once was.

395
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,427
Oh.

396
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,973
The age of adventurers is over.

397
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,231
Well, take a look. Tell me what you see.

398
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,656
It's a Protectorate satellite.
Military grade.

399
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,449
Hmm. It is military grade,

400
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,660
but it's not the Protectorate's,
it's mine.

401
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,037
Every 48 hours,

402
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,708
my stack is automatically needlecast
to it.

403
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,085
So your current self
has no memory of what happened?

404
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,461
No, whoever killed me

405
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,631
pulled the trigger ten minutes
before my backup went through.

406
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,883
Means all your memories
from those 48 hours are gone.

407
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:31,801
Completely.

408
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,556
There was an attempted hack
on my satellite feed

409
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,058
moments after my death.

410
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,394
Somebody wants me dead.

411
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,941
For all I know,
you did try to kill yourself.

412
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,569
-You just botched the job.

413
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:54,699
Mr. Kovacs, I am not the kind of man
who would take his own life.

414
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,160
And even if I were...

415
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,497
I'd not have bungled it in such a fashion.

416
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,127
If I had meant to die,
I would indeed be dead.

417
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,176
I don't want your money or your pardon.

418
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,636
I'll take eternity on ice, thanks.

419
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,805
You should take the day, Mr. Kovacs.

420
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,476
Go into the city,
remember what it is to feel alive,

421
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,562
and then give me your answer.

422
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,899
Oh, and please do
take the book.

423
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,402
Like everything else I'm offering you,
it's yours...

424
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,239
if you want it.

425
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,331
Tak.

426
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,478
All that water,
it's just like home.

427
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,190
Give or take
about 80 light years.

428
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,699
What are you doing here, big brother?

429
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,577
I should be asking you that.

430
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,080
That's easy.

431
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,998
I'm not real.

432
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,334
What's your excuse?

433
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,260
They own everything.

434
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,847
Just like she said they would.

435
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,436
</i>
-I don't know.

436
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,109
-Get fucked up, get laid...

437
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,574
go back on ice.

438
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,694
You look uncomfortable
in that skin, traveler.

439
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,614
New sleeve

440
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,411
I got Stallion, Somno, Tetrameth, Veuron,
Merge5, Stiff, Reaper.

441
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,038
Oh, this is some epic shit.

442
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,832
Then I'll take it all.

443
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,712
<i>♪ Don't you let my baby ride, man ♪</i>

444
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,964
<i>♪ Don't you let my baby ride, man ♪</i>

445
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,675
<i>♪ Don't you let my baby ride, man ♪</i>

446
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,136
<i>♪ Don't you let my baby ride ♪</i>

447
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,601
<i>Hey, bud. Over here.</i>
<i>Got some house quality for you. </i>

448
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,228
<i>Hey, big boy.</i>
 <i>Plans tonight?</i>

449
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,479
<i>Fresh out of the tank?</i>

450
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,147
<i>Luscious ladies of Heaven and Seven.</i>

451
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,066
<i>Stretch out your skin</i>
<i>on that new sleeve.</i>

452
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,235
<i>For just a few credits per minute...</i>

453
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,195
<i>One is good, but two?</i>

454
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,490
<i>Even better. </i>

455
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,035
<i>The Houses may be out of your reach,</i>
<i>but I'm not.</i>

456
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:13,624
<i>Come to Jerry's biocabins, the finest</i>
<i>in intimate experiences groundside...</i>

457
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:18,921
<i>The Raven Hotel provides sanctuary</i>
<i>to the weary traveler.</i>

458
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,301
<i>Come, let us enfold you</i>

459

<i>Panama Rose Fightdrome!</i>
<i>Always live, never 'cast.</i>

460
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,934
<i>Come see the strongest,</i>

461
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,103

462
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,315
<i>-Join us! Fight! Join us! Fight! Join us!</i>

463
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:41,235
What the...

464
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,328
-It's a broadcast blocker. Peace offering.

465
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,331
Wanna get a drink?

466
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,042
You know, I'm perfect right here.

467
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,168
Okay.

468
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,757
What are you doing here?

469
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,842
Being followed, apparently.

470
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,011
That's what police do
to psycho-terrorists.

471
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,471
Come on, you cannot call me that.

472
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,306
You could tell me
what Bancroft wants you for.

473
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:14,852
I could tell you it was your case.
And you fucked it up.

474
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,062
Are you high?

475
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,063
Yeah.

476
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,441
You're high. Just forget it.

477
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,817
Wait, wait.

478
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,153
Uh...

479
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,824
Uh...

480
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,203
Let's just start over, okay?

481
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,662
I'm Takeshi Kovacs.

482
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,791
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

483
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,043
You don't approve
of the Uprising-era killing machine.

484
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,381
I'm gonna pick the place.

485
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,096
How do you know it was my case?

486
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,139
It's called Envoy Intuition.

487
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,977
Total absorb of everything around you
without preconception or assumption.

488
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,188
-I see the details.
-Or you just got lucky.

489
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,857
Luck isn't a word
I'd associate with myself.

490
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,985
Yeah. Takeshi Kovacs.

491
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,489
Mercenary turned Envoy
turned mercenary again,

492
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,450
sole survivor of the Battle of Stronghold.

493
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,035
Known by quite a few names.

494
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,540
Mamba Lev, One Hand Rending...
What's the other one? Oh, the Icepick.

495
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,584
Yeah. I like that one.
You should call me Icepick.

496
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,171
So why would you care
what happened to Bancroft?

497
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,383
Who says I care about Bancroft?
You don't like him, though.

498
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,428
He wanted me reprimanded
when I couldn't find his killer.

499
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,347
Tried to screw with my career,
which means with my life.

500
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,391
And he's still fucking doin' it.

501
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,017
You saying you didn't deserve it?

502
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,104
I'm saying I polygraphed the wife
at her own insistence.

503
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,814
She passed without a twitch.

504
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,816
We chased down every lead.

505
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,902
Friends, enemies,
people with opportunity and motive,

506
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,779
and we always came back to the same thing.

507
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,283
Laurens Bancroft locked himself
in his study and blew his stack out.

508
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,619
And conveniently forgot that he'd be
resleeved less than an hour later.

509
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,998
Let me tell you what went over my desk
the night Bancroft bought it.

510
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:03,544
Four stabbings, ten shootings,
three of which were RDs by the way.

511
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,879
One sleeve kill.

512
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,757
Oh, no, not a sleeve kill, she was
a Neo-Catholic dumped in the bay.

513
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,760
Since she can't be resleeved,
she was actually murdered.

514
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,014
As opposed to Bancroft
who was incompetently murdered.

515
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,058
Are you a moron or just an asshole?
There's no Bancroft case!

516
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,025
Oh, honey, you don't like this model?

517
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,780
I can be whatever you want me to be.

518
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:35,826
No, thank you.
 We'll take the check.

519
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,411
No. No. We're not finished here.

520
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,079
-Yeah, you keep saying that.
-Yeah.

521
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,248
When a sleeve
has been slabbed for a long time,

522
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,251
the body keeps making hormones.
Did you know that?

523
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,461
Yeah. Everyone knows that.

524
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:49,340
You know that first time,
when you're fresh out of the tank--

525
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,674
Shut the fuck up.

526
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,843
I'm thinking since you took me out
for a drink--

527
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,721
You're paying, and one more time,
you're just an asshole.

528
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,224
-Not the first date to call me that.
-Also, not a date.

529
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,900
You know what my Envoy Intuition's
telling me right now?

530
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,363
Without question or reservation?

531
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,031
What?

532
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,244
Bancroft believed he was murdered.

533
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,167
Which made it a lot more fun
when I turned him down.

534
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,460
You what?

535
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,339
See, psycho-terrorists, we're not
so easy to predict as you'd think.

536
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,633
-Yeah.

537
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,176
This isn't my world.

538
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,054
-Oh.

539
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,515
I'm gonna be at the Raven
on Coronado Street

540
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,767
if you change your mind.
You should change your mind.

541
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,186
-You know that's one of the AI hotels.
-Mmm-hmm.

542
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,521
No one stays in them anymore.

543
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,817
Well, I got money and he's got girls,
so I think we'll be good.

544
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,194
They're hardwired
to want guests.

545
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,738
If you stay with one,
it's like sleeping with a stalker.

546
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:59,368
Hey, I'm moved by your concern
but I'm gonna get myself a nice meal,

547
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,995
couple of high-end hookers

548
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,415
with a little better appreciation
for the stamina of the newly resleeved,

549
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,251
and enjoy what's left
of my little vacation

550
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:12,339
before I go back to sleep forever. Cheers.

551
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,156
Felicitations.
You have arrived at the Raven,

552
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:40,784
Bay City's most deliciously macabre
lodging experience.

553
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,746
Fully cabled and enabled.

554
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,042
How can I ease your journey
through this world?

555
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,211
Ah, a room. The best everything.

556
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,882
Food, view, entertainment,
private kind of entertainment.

557
00:43:54,965 --> 00:44:00,512
A much-needed respite
from the trials of bleak existence.

558
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:06,226
The Raven offers VIP access to the
Houses of selective sexual tastes. Hmm?

559
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:11,190
The Temple of Eros affords
an oasis of indulgence in the Mojave.

560
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,109
Rock stars in Angels City.

561
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:20,157
And let us not forget our own...
satellite of sin,

562
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,450
Head in the Clouds.

563
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:25,829
No fantasy beyond reach
for the client of discerning means.

564
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,790
Well, I'm not that discerning.

565
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:35,005
From the sky above,
there is always the mud below.

566
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,674
I could guide you.

567
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,841
No.

568
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,260
For some elemental
and fast satisfaction in Licktown.

569
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,764
That won't be necessary.
Just, uh, have someone sent to my room.

570
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,767
Oh, the Raven can supply your chambers
with companions

571
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,186
-and accessories for any decadence.
-Good.

572
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,230
Perchance you could tell me
your preferences?

573
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,732
Nonverbal.
-Mmm-hmm.

574
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,444
I know one particular lady of the
night who seems a demure clerical worker

575
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:02,408
but carries in her briefcase instruments
of such delight it will tickle your bones.

576
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,409
I'll take it.

577
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,161
And how might you intend
to pay for your stay?

578
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,621
DNA trace. Bank of the Nation.

579
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,623
He won't be needing a room.

580
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,586
So much for Envoy Intuition.
Voodoo bullshit.

581
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,839
Pardon me, wayfarer,
we're in the midst of conversation.

582
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:21,301
Shut up, you piece of digibrain shit.
My microwave is smarter than you.

583
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,345
I just want one thing to go right today.

584
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,596
Clearly.

585
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,973
Too bad.

586
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,808
Turn around.

587
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,898
They said you'd be dangerous.
I thought you'd be bigger.

588
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,775
They made me bring all this backup.

589
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,944
What a waste of my time.
I don't need them.

590
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,028
Fuck you, Dimi.

591
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,701
Anyone else?

592
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,329
I have to clean that up.

593
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,914
What?

594
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,542
Uh, he had it coming. He was rude.

595
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:03,469
I could take you myself
without even breaking a sweat.

596
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,638
Move.

597
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,517
Good sir, I cannot assume
host prerogatives without payment.

598
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,271
<i>Host prerogatives.</i>

599
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,732
You're some kind of moron
staying in an AI hotel.

600
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:21,653
Possessive like a crazy girlfriend.
No one stays in them anymore.

601
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,947
I hadn't heard that.

602
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:29,286
For guest amenities,
please touch the screen.

603
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,626
Just one thing.

604
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,961
<i>They're hardwired to want guests.</i>

605
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,965
<i>Possessive like a crazy girlfriend.</i>

606
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,307
Touch the screen within 50 seconds.

607
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,726
You, shut up. You, get up.

608
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,941
It's not voodoo,
which, by the way, absolutely is bullshit.

609
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,067
Here he comes.

610
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,487
It's a form of
subliminal pattern recognition.

611
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,034
You know. It's... It's about the details.

612
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:14,540
Where's the big bad Envoy killer
from the past?

613
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,499
Twenty seconds.

614
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,084
Fight, God damn it!

615
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,504
What, you lost your balls?
Did something change while you were down?

616
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,005
-Nothing changed.
-Ten...

617
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,847
People like you are still stupid.

618
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,602
-I can now provide full guest amenities.

619
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,466
I see you.

620
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:42,753
Who sent you?

621
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,631
I was wrong about you, Envoy.

622
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,217
-Wait.
-Won't happen again.

623
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,302
No!

624
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,142
-Ask this of your microwave, miscreant.

625
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,150
Apologies.

626
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,655
Your room beckons.

627
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,283
If you'd like to freshen up
before the constabulary arrives.

628
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,130
What happened to a meal, getting laid,
and restacking forever?

629
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,590
I got interrupted.

630
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,387
Who the fuck are these guys?

631
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,473
I don't know. But they knew me.

632
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,642
They called you by name

633
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,478
Kristin. Four of them
are just local muscle,

634
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:45,065
but this sleeve
is registered to Dimitri Kadmin.

635
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,526
Ulan Bator registry.

636
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:49,986
-We got him.
-Yeah.

637
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,154
Got who?

638
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:56,159
Dimitri Kadmin,
hit man out of Vladivostok.

639
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,203
Otherwise known as Dimi the Twin.

640
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,580
Does a lot of work for the yakuza.

641
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,833
Dimitri doesn't trust anyone.

642
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,127
So, he makes an illegal copy of himself,

643
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,379
and downloads it
into a black market sleeve.

644
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,048
It's called double-sleeving.

645
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,510
The penalty is real death.

646
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,138
We hold onto his stack, sooner or later,

647
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,931
we catch the other version
of him out there,

648
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,641
and then, he's done.

649
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,563
Oh, motherfucker.
 What's going on?

650
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,565
Shit.
 What?

651
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,150
It's fragged.

652
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,860
Let me see.

653
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,573
-I'm getting a positive ID, but...

654
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,451
...not enough left
to spin him up to interrogate. Fuck.

655
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,536
You couldn't just disable them?

656
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,789
I was coming to the defense
of my first guest in five decades.

657
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,167
With enough firepower
to bring down an airplane.

658
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,628
I'm fully licensed
for customer protection.

659
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,882
And in any case,
his attackers were remarkably rude.

660
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,176
-You've shot people for less, so...

661
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,261
-Okay.

662
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,888
So, Dimitri's a high

663
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,055
Yeah. Top of the line.

664
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,892
Well, then Bancroft's death
wasn't a suicide.

665
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,059
Of course.

666
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,854
Because who would want
to kill an asshole like you?

667
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:09,983
Plenty of people. A few centuries ago.
See, I don't merit this kind of hit

668
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,986
unless you want to stop me
from looking into Bancroft's death.

669
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:17,699
So, instead of blaming me, how about
you apply your impressive policing skills.

670
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,327
Less than eight hours
out of the tank,

671
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,246
and you're up to your eyes in
organic damage and real death.

672
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,749
I could find a way to arrest you for this.

673
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,543
Yeah?
You make up your mind, I'll be upstairs.

674
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,920
-No, you're not--
-Kristin.

675
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,756
Leave it. Leave it.

676
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,082
<i>This enemy you cannot defeat.</i>

677
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,920
<i>You can only drive it deeper inside you.</i>

678
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,726
<i>Is that really what you want to do</i>
<i>with your only night on Earth?</i>

679
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,186
I don't know...

680
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,565
how to be in this world without you.

681
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,567
-I'm here.
-You're dead.

682
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,902
Tak.

683
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,908
I don't...

684
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,078
I don't have to go back on ice.

685
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:33,084
I... could just end it now.

686
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,796
Make it stop.

687
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,552
Just blow out my stack,
make it all go away...

688
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:48,642
If you do that, it won't all go away.

689
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,311
-Just you.

690
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,271
-Tak.

691
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,701
Two hundred and fifty years
is long enough.

692
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,620
Move on.

693
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,372
Never.

694
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,085
You hear me?

695
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,423
-Not ever.
-Then do what you were born to do.

696
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,511
What I trained you to do.
Make things change.

697
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,429
By saving a Meth?

698
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,431
There's more here
than you're willing to see.

699
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,810
It's not the threat.
It's the unanswered question.

700
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:36,815
The mystery that needs to be solved.
The box that needs to be unlocked.

701
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,778
Envoys take what is offered, Tak.

702
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,990
Take this chance.

703
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,742
This is how you finish the mission.

704
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,202
Without you?

705
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,287
Finish the mission.
